# Chat
This is demo app for demonstrating different frameworks and techniques for automated testing. It contains test automation framework with Espresso library while using scalable architecture POM to retrieve text actions. Also, for increasing efficiency of test exicusion I used  Espresso Idling Resources to Deal with asynchronous operations. All codes are written in Kotlin

# Espresso test
To run an Espresso test, use the Project  window on the left side of the Android Studio IDE:

Open the chat app module folder and navigate to the test you want to run. 

Navigate to java > malanii.petro.chat (androidTest).

Right-click on the test you want to run and click Run.

In the Select Deployment Target window, choose the device on which you want to run the test. If necessary, create a new Android Virtual Device. Click OK.

Monitor the progress of your test in the Run window at the bottom of the IDE. Android Studio runs a full build of the project and opens a tab with the name of the test in the Run window. You can check whether your test passes or fails in this tab, as well as how long the test took to run.
